# PastaTimer
## A concept for a timer app for Wear OS. Cook your pasta al dente!

**This is just a design concept for a future app for Wear OS.**
<br>The goal is simple: to create a timer that give you the correct time for pasta cooked al dente.


Usual steps you follow:
<br>Take the pasta package, look for the suggested time, manually set a timer.

Proposed UX in the app:
<br>Select the brand from a list, tap the pasta type. The timer starts.
